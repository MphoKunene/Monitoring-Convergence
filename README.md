# Monitoring-Convergence
In your main iteration loop, for each data point, calculate the squared  distance between each point and the cluster mean to which it belongs,  and sum all of these squared distance

Create a text file called ‘interpretation.txt’ and fill in your answers to the questions below. Run k-means using 3 clusters on the 1953 and 2008 datasets separately. What do you see? Take note of how the clusters change from 1953 to 2008. You will need to pay attention not only to which countries are in clusters together but also to the Life Expectancy and BirthRates for those clusters. Next, run the algorithm with 4 clusters on dataBoth.csv. Note any observations in your text file. Which countries are moving up clusters? How does (2008)South Africa” compare to “(1953)United States”? Are there any 2008 countries that are in a cluster that is made up mostly of 1953 countries? Try and explain why. Are there any 1953 countries that are in a cluster that is made up of mostly 2008 countries? Try and explain why in your text file.
